# Qt Creator - Godot project wizard
Godot C++ project wizard for Qt Creator

This tool is created for programmers who want to quickly setup new GDNative library projects within seconds.
[See also the Qt Creator Godot class wizard.](https://github.com/CZHeron/Qt-Creator-Godot-class-wizard/) It saves a lot of time, when you need a new class for a node.

### Installation
Just copy the folder `godotcpplib` to this path:
`QtCreator/share/qtcreator/templates/wizards/projects/`

### Setting up a new project
Using this wizard is simple. 
1. Just click on `New Project`
1. Select `Non-Qt Project` 
1. Choose `GDNative C++ Library`.
1. Enter the project name.
1. Click `Next`.
1. Select the actual path to your generated C++ bindings folder.
1. Finish the setup like any other project.

You can optionally set your Run Settings like it's on the picture to make your life easier.

#### What's next
I'm planing to add more template classes in the future.
Feel free to suggest changes.
