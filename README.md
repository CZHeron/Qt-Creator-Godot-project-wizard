# Qt Creator - Godot project wizard
Godot C++ project wizard for Qt Creator

Just copy the folder `godotcpplib` to this path:
`QtCreator/share/qtcreator/templates/wizards/projects/`

This wizard is simple, just click on `New Project`, select `Non-Qt Project` and `GDNative C++ Library`.

Enter the project name.
Click `Next`.
Select the actual path to your engine folder.
Select the actual path to your generated C++ bindings folder.

I'm planing to add more template classes in the future.
Feel free to suggest changes.
